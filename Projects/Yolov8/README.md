# YoloV8 tests

It is raw tests, makefile is awful for now.

How to compile:
```bash
# export cross compilers (musl stdlib) to current shell
export PATH=$PATH:/home/stephan/Downloads/LicheeRV_CrossCompilers/gcc/riscv64-linux-musl-x86_64/bin
# export SDK into SDK_PATH var
export SDK_PATH=/home/stephan/Downloads/CVI_SDK

make build
```
